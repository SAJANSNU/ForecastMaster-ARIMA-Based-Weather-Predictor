# ForecastMaster-ARIMA-Based-Weather-Predictor

## Overview
ForecastMaster is an ARIMA-based weather prediction tool that utilizes historical weather data to forecast future maximum temperatures. This project uses the Statsmodels library for time series analysis and forecasting, specifically employing the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

## Installation
To use ForecastMaster, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```
    pip install statsmodels gradio
    ```
2. Clone or download the ForecastMaster repository from GitHub.

## Usage
### Running the Weather Prediction Model
1. Execute the script `forecast_master.py`.
2. Input the number of days you want to predict the maximum temperature for.
3. The script will generate the forecasted maximum temperatures for the specified number of days.

### Viewing Predictions via Web Interface
1. Launch the Gradio interface by executing the script `forecast_master.py`.
2. Input the number of days you want to predict the maximum temperature for.
3. Gradio will display the forecasted maximum temperatures interactively.

### Saving the Model
The trained ARIMA model will be saved as `MINIPROJECTWEATHERFORECASTING` for future use.
